# Python-Challenge
In this repository, there are two main.py Python files.  One is for the PyBank project, and one is for the PyPoll project.  They are located under their respective files. In order to run these files, you must have a Resources folder under both the PyBank and PyPoll folder, with the PyBank Resources folder containing a .csv file named budget_data.csv, and with the PyPoll Resources folder containing a .csv file named election_data.csv.  

The PyBank Python file reads in budget_data.csv, and runs analysis on it to find the total months located in the .csv file, the total profit/losses that occurred over the timespan of the data, calculates the total difference and average of the profit/losses that occurred over the timespan of the data, and finally finds the largest increase and decrease in profits over the timespan of the data.

The PyPoll Python file reads in election_data.csv, and calculates data based on election candidates.  Caculations include the total number of votes cast for all candidates, a list of all candidates running, the percentage and total number of votes cast for each candidate, and the winner of the election.
